    Results of analyses of 500 \datasets simulated with six comparisons
    comprising a mix of three populations that experienced a demographic change
    and three pairs of populations that diverged.
    The performance of estimating the timing (top row) and sharing (bottom row)
    of events are shown separately for the three populations that experienced a
    demographic change (left column) and the three pairs of populations that
    diverged (right column).
    The plots of the demographic comparisons (left column) are comparable
    to the second column of \figs
    \ref{fig:valsimsetimesopt}
    and
    \ref{fig:valsimsmodelopt};
    the same priors on event times and ancestral population size were used.
    Time estimates for which the potential-scale reduction factor was greater than
    1.2 \citep{Brooks1998} are highlighted in orange.
    % Each plot shows the results from 500 simulated \datasets, each with
    % six taxa.
