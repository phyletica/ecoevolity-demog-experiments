    The performance of estimating the model of demographic changes
    (top two rows)
    versus model of divergences
    (bottom two rows)
    when the priors are correct
    (first and third rows)
    versus when the priors are diffuse
    (second and fourth rows).
    \diffusesimsfourcolumndescription
    Each plot shows the results of the analyses of 500 simulated \datasets,
    each with three taxa;
    the number of \datasets that fall within each possible cell
    of true versus estimated model is shown, and cells with
    more \datasets are shaded darker.
    \modelplotannotations
    The first row of plots are repeated from
    \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsmodelopt}
    for comparison.
