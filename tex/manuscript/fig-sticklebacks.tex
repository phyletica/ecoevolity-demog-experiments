    Estimates of the number (Row 1), timing (Row 2), and magnitude (Row 3)
    of demographic events across five stickleback populations, when using all
    sites (left column) or only variable sites (right column).
    Analyses of six taxa comprising a mix of three populations that
    experienced a demogrpahic change and three pairs of populations that
    diverged.
    For the number of events (Row 1), the light and dark bars represent the
    prior and posterior probabilities, respectively.
    Time (Row 2) is in units of expected subsitutions per site.
    For the violin plots, each plotted circle and associated error bars
    represent the posterior mean and 95\% credible interval.
    Bar graphs were generated with ggplot2 Version 2.2.1 \citep{ggplot2};
    violin plots were generated with matplotlib Version 2.0.0
    \citep{matplotlib}.
