    The accuracy and precision of demographic event time estimates (in units of
    expected subsitutions per site) when data are simulated and analyzed under
    the same model (i.e., no model misspecification), and event times are
    exponentially distributed with a mean of 0.01
    (1.25 units of $4N_e$ generations).
    \validationsimsthreecolumndescription
    Each plotted circle and associated error bars represent the posterior mean
    and 95\% credible interval.
    Estimates for which the potential-scale reduction factor was greater than
    1.2 \citep{Brooks1998} are highlighted in orange.
    Each plot consists of 1500 estimates---500 simulated \datasets, each with
    three taxa.
