    The accuracy and precision of event time estimates, in units of
    expected subsitutions per site, when data are simulated and analyzed
    under the same model
    (i.e., no model misspecification).
    \validationsimsthreecolumndescription
    Each plotted circle and associated error bars represent the posterior mean
    and 95\% credible interval for the time that a pair of populations
    diverged.
    Each plot consists of 1500 estimates---500 simulated \datasets, each with
    three pairs of populations.
