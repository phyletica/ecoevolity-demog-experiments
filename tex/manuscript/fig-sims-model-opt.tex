    The performance of estimating the model of demographic changes when data
    are simulated and analyzed under the same model (i.e., no model
    misspecification), and event times are
    gamma-distributed with a shape of 4, offset of 0.0001, and mean of 0.002
    (0.25 units of $4N_e$ generations).
    \validationsimsthreecolumndescription
    Each plot shows the results of the analyses of 500 simulated \datasets,
    each with three population pairs;
    the number of \datasets that fall within each possible cell
    of true versus estimated model is shown, and cells with
    more \datasets are shaded darker.
