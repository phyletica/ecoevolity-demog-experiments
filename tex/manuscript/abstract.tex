Many biotic and abiotic factors that influence the distribution, abundance, and
diversification of species can simultaneously affect multiple evolutionary
lineages within or across communities.
These include environmental changes and inter-specific ecological interactions
that can cause the ranges of multiple, co-distributed species to contract,
expand, or become fragmented.
Such processes predict temporally clustered patterns of evolutionary events
across species, such as synchronous population divergences and/or changes in
population size.
This has generated interest in developing statistical methods that infer such
patterns from genetic data.
We introduce a general, full-likelihood Bayesian method that can estimate
temporal clustering of an arbitrary mix of population divergences and
population size changes.
We use this method to assess how well we can infer temporal patterns of shared
divergences and changes in effective population size when using all the
information in genomic data.
We find that estimating the timing and sharing of demographic changes is much
more challenging than divergences.
Even under favorable simulation conditions, the ability to infer shared
demographic events is quite limited and very sensitive to prior assumptions,
which is in sharp contrast to accurate, precise, and robust estimates of shared
divergence times.
Our results also suggest that previous estimates of co-expansion among
stickleback populations are likely caused by lack of information in
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data that ignores invariant sites.
We conclude by discussing potential avenues to improve inferences of
synchronous demographic changes across populations.
