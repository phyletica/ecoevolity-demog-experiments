We find that estimating the timing and sharing of demographic changes is much
more challenging than divergence times.
Even under the most favorable simulation conditions, the ability to infer
shared demographic events is quite limited.
Our results also suggest that previous estimates of co-expansion among
stickleback populations are likely caused by lack of information in
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data that ignores invariant sites.
