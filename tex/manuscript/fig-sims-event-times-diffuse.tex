    The accuracy and precision of time estimates of demographic changes
    (top two rows)
    versus divergences
    (bottom two rows)
    when the priors are correct
    (first and third rows)
    versus when the priors are diffuse
    (second and fourth rows).
    Time is measured in units of expected subsitutions per site. 
    \diffusesimsfourcolumndescription
    Each plotted circle and associated error bars represent the posterior mean
    and 95\% credible interval.
    Estimates for which the potential-scale reduction factor was greater than
    1.2 \citep{Brooks1998} are highlighted in orange.
    Each plot consists of 1500 estimates---500 simulated \datasets, each with
    three
    demographic comparisons (Rows 1--2) or
    divergence comparisons (Rows 3--4).
