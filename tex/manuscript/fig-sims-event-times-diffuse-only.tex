    The accuracy and precision of time estimates of demographic changes when
    the prior distributions are diffuse
    (Conditions \missimcondition{1}--\missimcondition{4};
    Table~\ref{table:simconditions}).
    Time is measured in units of expected subsitutions per site. 
    \diffusesimsonlyfourcolumndescription
    Each plotted circle and associated error bars represent the posterior mean
    and 95\% credible interval.
    Estimates for which the potential-scale reduction factor was greater than
    1.2 \citep{Brooks1998} are highlighted in orange.
    Each plot consists of 1500 estimates---500 simulated \datasets, each with
    three
    demographic comparisons.
