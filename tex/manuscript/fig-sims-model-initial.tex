    \validationsimsthreecolumndescription
    Each plot shows the results of the analyses of 500 simulated \datasets,
    each with three population pairs;
    the number of \datasets that fall within each possible cell
    of true versus estimated model is shown, and cells with
    more \datasets are shaded darker.
