    The performance of estimating the model of demographic changes
    when data were simulated and analyzed under the same
    distributions we initially explored
    (Table~S\ref{table:prelimsimconditions}).
    % when data
    % are simulated and analyzed under the same model (i.e., no model
    % misspecification), and event times are exponentially distributed with a
    % mean of 0.01
    % (1.56 units of $4N_e$ generations).

    Each plot shows the results of the analyses of 500 simulated \datasets,
    each with three demographic comparisons;
    the number of \datasets that fall within each possible cell
    of true versus estimated model is shown, and cells with
    more \datasets are shaded darker.
