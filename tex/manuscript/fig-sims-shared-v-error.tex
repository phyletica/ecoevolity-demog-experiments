    Sharing a demographic change event with more populations does not increase
    accuracy (as measured by absolute error; Row 1) or precision (as measured
    by the width of the 95\% credible interval; Row 2),
    regardless of whether all sites (Column 1) or only variable sites
    (Column 2) are analyzed.
    Each plot shows the results from 500 \datasets simulated under
    Condition~\vsimfourinc (Table~\ref{table:simconditions}) with six
    demographic comparisons.
