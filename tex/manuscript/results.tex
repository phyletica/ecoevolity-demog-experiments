\subsubsection{Estimating timing and sharing of demographic changes}

The ability of \ecoevolity to estimate the timing of
demographic events
(\fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsetimesinitial})
and the assignment of populations to the
events
(\fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsmodelinitial})
was quite poor across all the simulation conditions we initially explored.
For these initial conditions, we simulated \datasets with three populations
that underwent a demographic change, under a variety of distributions on the
relative size of the ancestral population.
These included four gamma probability distributions with a shape of 10 and a
mean of
0.25 (4-fold population increase),
0.5 (2-fold population increase),
2.0 (2-fold population decrease), and
1.0 (no change on average, but a fair amount of variance).
We also used a gamma distribution with a shape of 100 and mean of 1.0
to mimic ``worst-case'' conditions when there was almost no demographic
changes in the history of the populations.
The timing of unique size changes was exponentially distributed with a mean of
0.01 expected substitutions per site.
The expected descendant population size
(scaled by the mutation rate; \epopsize\murate)
was 0.002,
which puts our expectation for the size-change times in units of $4N_e$
generations at 1.25.
Our motivation for this distribution of times was to span values
that were ``easy'' and ``hard'' to estimate;
i.e., a mix of size changes that occurred more recently
than the gene copies coalesced and thus would be generate data with information
about when the change happened,
and those that occurred when few or no gene lineages were left to coalesce, and
thus would generate data with limited information about the timing of the
event.

Under the ``worst-case'' scenario of essentially no population-size change
(bottom row of \figs \ref{fig:valsimsetimesinitial} and
\ref{fig:valsimsmodelinitial}), our method is unable to identify the timing or
model of demographic change.
The method returns the prior on the timing of events 
(bottom row of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsetimesinitial})
and almost always prefers either a model with a single, shared demographic
event (model "000") or independent demographic changes (model "012").
(bottom row of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsmodelinitial}).
This is expected behavior, because there is essentially no information in the
data about the timing of demographic changes, and a Dirichlet process with a
concentration parameter of 1.41422, puts approximately 0.24 prior probability
on the models with one and three events, and 0.515 prior probability on the
three models with two events (approximately 0.17 each).
Thus, with little information, the method prefers one of the two models with
larger prior probability.

Under considerable changes in population size, the method only faired
moderately better at estimating the timing of demographic events
(top three rows of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsetimesinitial}).
The ability to identify the model improved under these
conditions, but the frequency at which the correct model
was preferred only exceeded 50\% for the large population
expansions, and the median posterior support for the correct
model was very small (less than 0.58) under all conditions.
(top three rows of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsmodelinitial}).
Under all simulation conditions, estimates of timing and sharing
of the demographic events are better when using all characters
rather than only variable characters
(second versus third column of \figs
\ref{fig:valsimsetimesinitial}
and
\ref{fig:valsimsmodelinitial}).


We observed numerical problems when the change in population size was
either very recent or old relative to the effective size of the descendant
population.
In such cases either very few or almost all of the gene lineages coalesce in
the descendant branch, providing almost no information about the magnitude or
timing of the population-size change.
In these cases, the data were well explained by no expansion, which could be
achieved in three ways: an expansion time of zero and an ancestral population
size that matched the true population size, an old expansion and a
descendant population size that matched the true population size, or an
intermediate expansion time and both the ancestral and descendant sizes matched the
true time.
The true population size being matched was that of the descendant or ancestral
population if the expansion was old or recent, respectively.
This caused MCMC chains to converge to different regions of parameter
space
(highlighted in orange in \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsetimesinitial}).

In an effort to find conditions under which the timing and sharing of
demographic changes could be better estimated, and avoid combinations
of parameter values that caused nonidentifiability problems,
we next explored simulations under distributions on times and population sizes
offset from zero, but with much more recent demographic event times.
% Event time ~ gamma(shape=4.0, scale=0.000475, offset=0.0001); mean 0.002
% relative root size ~ gamma(shape=5.0, scale = 0.04, offset = 0.05); mean 0.25
% relative root size ~ gamma(shape=5.0, scale = 0.09, offset = 0.05); mean 0.5
% relative root size ~ gamma(shape=5.0, scale = 0.79, offset = 0.05); mean 4
% relative root size ~ gamma(shape=5.0, scale = 0.19, offset = 0.05); mean 1
% relative root size ~ gamma(shape=50.0, scale = 0.02, offset = 0.0); mean 1
For the distribution of event times, we used a gamma distribution
with a shape of 4, offset of 0.0001, and a mean of 0.002 (accounting
for the offset; 0.25 units of $4N_e$ generations on average).
In combination with this distribution on event times,
we used five different gamma distributions on the relative
effective size of the ancestral population.
Four of these had a shape of 5, an offset of 0.05, and a mean
of
0.25 (4-fold increase),
0.5 (2-fold increase),
4 (4-fold decrease),
and
1 (no change on average).
The last gamma distribution on the relative ancestral size was a shape of 50
and a mean of 1.

Even when trying to make the simulated conditions ``optimal'' for identifying
the event times, the ability to infer the correct timing and sharing of
demographic events remains quite poor
(\figs \ref{fig:valsimsetimesopt} and \ref{fig:valsimsmodelopt}).
Under the recent (but not too recent) 4-fold population-size increase (on
average) scenario, we do see better estimates of the times of the demographic
change
(top row of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsetimesopt}),
but the ability to idenfify the correct model remains quite poor;
\ecoevolity only prefers the correct model 57\% of the time, with
a median posterior probability of the correct model of 0.42
(top row of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsmodelopt}).
Under the most extreme population retraction scenario (4-fold, on average),
\ecoevolity only estimates the correct model 40\% of the time, with a median
posterior probability of the correct model of only 0.26
(middle row of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsmodelopt}).
Estimates are especially poor when using only variable characters,
so we focus on the results using all characters.

\subsubsection{Simulations to assess sensitivity to prior assumptions}

We observe the best estimates of the timing and sharing of demographic
events under narrow distributions on the relative effective size of the
ancestral distribution
(top row of \figs
\labelcref{fig:valsimsetimesinitial,fig:valsimsmodelinitial,fig:valsimsetimesopt,fig:valsimsmodelopt}),
which were used to both simulate the data and as the prior
when those data were analzyed.
These distributions are unrealistically informative priors for empirical
studies, for which there is usually little \emph{a priori} information about
past population sizes.
To determine whether the better performance under these distributions was
caused by more informative data or priors, we simulated \datasets under a
narrow distribution on the relative ancestral population size, and analyzed
these \datasets under more realistic, ``diffuse'' prior distributions on
populations sizes and event times.
This will also us to assess how sensitive the inference of the timing
and sharing of demographic events is to prior assumptions.
For comparison, we repeated the same simulations for pairs of populations for
which we estimated the timing and sharing of their divergences (the same total
number of gene copies were sampled from each pair).

% Sim disributions:
% Event time ~ gamma(shape=4.0, scale=0.000475, offset=0.0001); mean 0.002
% relative root size ~ gamma(shape=5.0, scale = 0.04, offset = 0.05); mean 0.25
% relative root size ~ gamma(shape=5.0, scale = 0.04, offset = 3.8); mean 4.0
% descendant size ~ gamma(4.0, scale=0.0005, offset = 0.0001); mean 0.0021
% Priors:
% Event time ~ exponential(mean = 0.005)
% relative root size ~ Exponential(mean = 2.0)
% descendant size ~ gamma(2.0, scale 0.001); mean 0.002

We find that the inference of shared demographic events is quite sensitive to
the priors, and we see a stronger bias toward underestimating the number of
events under the more realistic diffuse priors
(top two rows of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsmodeldiffuse}).
Under the diffuse priors, the probability of inferring the correct model of
demographic events decreases from 0.57 to 0.434 when all characters are used,
and from 0.36 to 0.284 when only variable characters are used.
The median posterior probability of the correct model also decreases from
0.422 to 0.292 when all characters are used,
and from 0.231 to 0.178 when only variable characters are used
(top two rows of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsmodeldiffuse}).
In comparison, the inference of shared divergences is much more
accurate and precise than shared demographic changes, and
the former is much more robust to the diffuse priors
(bottom two rows of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsmodeldiffuse}).
When all characters are used, under both the correct and diffuse
priors, the correct model is preferred over 91\% of the time,
and the median posterior probability of the correct model is over
0.93.

The results are similar when we look at the estimates of the timing of
demographic changes and divergences
(top versus bottom two rows of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsetimesdiffuse}).
The precision of time estimates of demographic changes decreases
substantially under the diffuse priors
(top two rows of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsetimesdiffuse}),
whereas the precision of the divergence-time estimates
is high and largely unchanged under the diffuse priors
(bottom two rows of \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsetimesdiffuse}).

\subsection{Inferring a mix of shared divergences and demographic changes}
Next, we simulated datasets with six comparisons, comprising a mix of three
populations that experienced a demographic change and thre pairs of populations
that diverged.
For these mixed-comparison simulations, we used a gamma distribution on event
times with a shape of 4, offset of 0.0001, and a mean of 0.002 subsitutions per
site (accounting for the offset; 0.25 units of $4N_e$ generations on average).
For the distribution on the relative size of the ancestral population,
we used a gamma distribution with a shape of 5, an offset of 0.05, and a mean
of 0.5; a 2-fold population size increase on average.
These are the same distributions used for the second row of
\figs
\ref{fig:valsimsetimesopt}
and
\ref{fig:valsimsmodelopt}.

We summarized the timing and sharing of the demographic changes
separately from the divergences so that we could determine whether the
divergence-time estimates could help improve the estimates of the
times of the demographic changes.
We confirm that the ability to infer the timing and sharing of
demographic changes remains poor, while estimates of
shared divergences remain accurate and precise
(\fig{}~\ref{fig:mixsims}).
The estimates of the timing and sharing of demographic
events are very similar to when we simulated and
analzyed only three demographic comparisons under the
same distributions
(compare left column of \fig{}~\ref{fig:mixsims}
to the second row of \figs
\ref{fig:valsimsetimesopt}
and
\ref{fig:valsimsmodelopt}).
