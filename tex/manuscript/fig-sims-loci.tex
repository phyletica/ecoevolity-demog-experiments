\mFigure{1.0}{../../results/cropped-grid-loci-short.pdf}{
    Results of analyses of simulated \datasets
    with 5000 100-base-pair loci when using all characters (left column) or
    only unlinked variable characters (right column).
    The plots are comparable to the first row of \figs
    \ref{fig:valsimsetimesopt}
    and
    \ref{fig:valsimsmodelopt};
    the models were identical,
    the only difference is the linkage of characters into loci.
    Time estimates for which the potential-scale reduction factor was greater than
    1.2 \citep{Brooks1998} are highlighted in orange.
    Each plot shows the results from 500 simulated \datasets, each with
    six taxa.
