    Estimates of the timing (top row) and sharing (bottom row) of demographic
    changes when using all characters (left column) or only unlinked variable
    characters (right column) from \datasets simulated with 5000 loci of 100
    linked bases from three demographic comparisons.
    The plots are comparable to the first row of \figs
    \ref{fig:valsimsetimesopt}
    and
    \ref{fig:valsimsmodelopt};
    the only difference is the linkage of characters into loci.
    Time estimates for which the potential-scale reduction factor was greater than
    1.2 \citep{Brooks1998} are highlighted in orange.
    Each plot shows the results from 500 simulated \datasets, each with
    three demographic comparisons.
