    The performance of estimating the model of demographic changes when the
    prior distributions are diffuse
    (Conditions \missimcondition{1}--\missimcondition{4};
    Table~\ref{table:simconditions}).

    Each plot consists of 1500 estimates---500 simulated \datasets, each with
    three demographic comparisons;
    the number of \datasets that fall within each possible cell
    of true versus estimated model is shown, and cells with
    more \datasets are shaded darker.
    \modelplotannotations
    The first row of plots are repeated from
    \fig{}~\ref{fig:valsimsetimesdiffuse}
    for comparison.
