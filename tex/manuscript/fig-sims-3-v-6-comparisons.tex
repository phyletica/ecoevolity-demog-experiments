    Estimates of the timing (Row 1),
    and sharing (Row 2) of demographic events,
    ancestral population size (Row 4),
    and descendant population size (Row 5)
    when three (Columns 1 and 3) versus
    six (Columns 2 and 4) demographic comparisons are analyzed.
    Each column plots the results from 500 \datasets
    simulated under Condition~\vsimfourinc (Table~\ref{table:simconditions}).
    Estimates for which the potential-scale reduction factor was greater than
    1.2 \citep{Brooks1998} are highlighted in orange.
